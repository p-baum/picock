Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`:

- `engineering/`: daily code work
- `productivity/`: daily non-code workflow tools
- `misc/`: kept around but rarely used, not promoted
- `in-progress/`: beta: public on purpose, feedback wanted, not shipped in the plugin
- `deprecated/`: no longer used

The `engineering/setup-matt-pocock-skills` skill contains remediations for installing on non claude agents. Before making code changes to improve pi compatibilty always check if this skill impacts the changes being considered.

Every skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/` (the **promoted** buckets) must have a reference in the top-level `README.md`. Skills in `misc/`, `personal/`, `in-progress/`, and `deprecated/` must not appear there.

This fork is distributed for Pi, not Claude Code. Ignore upstream Claude Code plugin/marketplace surfaces (`.claude-plugin/*`) unless a change leaks into Pi-facing docs, package discovery, or validation. Do not run or require `claude plugin validate . --strict` for this fork.

Install commands for upstream Claude/skills.sh surfaces are copied verbatim from [.agents/install-block.md](./.agents/install-block.md), but Pi-facing docs must describe the Pi package workflow and `/skill:<name>` invocation.

Each skill entry in the top-level `README.md` must link the skill name to its `SKILL.md`.

Each bucket folder has a `README.md` that lists every skill in the bucket with a one-line description, with the skill name linked to its `SKILL.md`. The promoted buckets' `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**; non-promoted bucket `README.md`s (`misc/`, `in-progress/`) use a flat list.

Skills in `engineering/` and `productivity/` also have a human-facing docs page at `docs/<bucket>/<skill-name>.md` (the docs tree mirrors those two bucket folders under `skills/`). The published URL is `https://aihero.dev/skills-<skill-name>` regardless of bucket: the docs path is repo organisation only. When you add, rename, or change the behaviour of a skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/`, create or re-sync its docs page following [.agents/writing-docs.md](./.agents/writing-docs.md). A finished page carries four sections: **What it does**, **When to reach for it**, **Common questions**, and **It's working if**. `writing-docs.md` holds the template, the section order, and where to hunt for the questions. Skills in the non-promoted buckets (`misc/`, `in-progress/`, `deprecated/`) get **no** docs page.

Every `SKILL.md` is either user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true` plus `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`, reachable only by the human) or model-invoked (model- or user-reachable). See [.agents/invocation.md](./.agents/invocation.md).

[`ask-matt`](./skills/engineering/ask-matt/SKILL.md) is the router that maps every user-reachable skill and how they relate. The same trigger that re-syncs a docs page applies to it: whenever you add, rename, remove, or change how a user-reachable skill fits the flows, re-read `ask-matt`'s `SKILL.md` and update it so the map stays accurate: a new skill it never mentions, or a stale one it still routes to, is a router that lies.

To (re)link every skill into local non-Claude harness skill directories such as `~/.agents/skills`, run `scripts/link-skills.sh`. Each entry is a symlink into this repo, so a `git pull` keeps installed skills current; re-run the script after adding, removing, or renaming a skill.
