# Sync Upstream

Bring the fork up to date without washing away its Pi adaptations. The defining idea is a **compatibility gate**: upstream is not ready to merge until every incoming change has been checked against the fork's Pi distribution and harness behavior.

This skill is specific to the `p-baum/picock` fork of `mattpocock/skills`. Use `GH_TOKEN="$PI_GITHUB_PAT" gh ...` when GitHub CLI authentication needs the fork owner's token.

## 1. Establish the sync range

- Require a clean worktree. Stop and report any local changes rather than stashing them.
- Inspect `git remote -v`; verify `origin` is the fork and `upstream` is `mattpocock/skills`. Add or repair only the `upstream` fetch remote after confirming with the user.
- Fetch `origin` and `upstream`, including pruning stale remote refs.
- Read the repository instructions and the complete `setup-matt-pocock-skills` skill before assessing compatibility.
- Identify the fork's default branch and upstream's default branch from the remotes rather than assuming `main`.
- Record the exact range `origin/<default>..upstream/<default>`, its commits, and changed files. If the range is empty, report that the fork is current and stop without creating branches, issues, or PRs.

Completion criterion: the exact upstream commit range and both endpoint SHAs are known, with a clean worktree.

## 2. Open the sync PR

- Create a fresh branch from `origin/<default>` named `sync/upstream-<YYYY-MM-DD>`, adding a numeric suffix if it already exists.
- Merge `upstream/<default>` into it with a merge commit so upstream provenance remains visible. Preserve fork-specific behavior when resolving conflicts; use the `resolving-merge-conflicts` skill when conflicts occur.
- Run the repository's relevant validation, including `npm run validate:skills`. After manifest changes, also run `claude plugin validate . --strict` when the command is available.
- Push the branch to `origin` and open a draft PR against the fork's default branch. The body must include the upstream range, endpoint SHAs, conflict resolutions, and validation results.

The PR stays draft until the compatibility gate is complete. Never merge it.

Completion criterion: a draft sync PR exists and names the exact upstream delta.

## 3. Audit the compatibility gate

Audit only behavior introduced or changed by the upstream range, while reading enough surrounding code to understand its effect. When sub-agents are available, delegate independent areas in parallel, then verify their evidence yourself.

Check every changed skill and distribution surface against:

- Pi skill discovery in `package.json`, including promoted and excluded buckets.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, top-level and bucket READMEs, docs pages, and `ask-matt` routing.
- `scripts/link-skills.sh` and `scripts/validate-skill-distribution.mjs`.
- Invocation differences: Pi `/skill:<name>`, bare commands in Claude/skills.sh harnesses, frontmatter, and `agents/openai.yaml`.
- Tool assumptions, especially Claude-only tools, sub-agent APIs, hooks, browser access, filesystem locations, and authentication.
- Existing Pi compatibility adaptations and their intent, using repository history and `docs/pi-compatibilty-review.md` as evidence. Treat the review as historical context, not current truth.
- The `setup-matt-pocock-skills` workflow whenever an incoming change affects installation, setup, discovery, or per-repo configuration.

Classify every changed file as:

1. **Compatible** — no fork adaptation required.
2. **Already adapted** — existing fork behavior still covers it.
3. **Remediation required** — Pi would lose functionality, receive incorrect instructions, or diverge from the repository's distribution policy.

Write this file-by-file audit into the draft sync PR body. Every changed file must have a classification and evidence; a general impression is not a completed audit.

Completion criterion: every file in the upstream delta is classified and every remediation has a concrete acceptance criterion.

## 4. Raise remediation issues and PRs

For each independent remediation:

- Search open and closed issues and PRs first; update or reuse an exact existing item instead of duplicating it.
- Create a GitHub issue on `p-baum/picock` explaining the upstream trigger, Pi impact, evidence, and checkable acceptance criteria.
- Create a branch from the sync branch, implement only that remediation, and run focused checks plus the distribution validations.
- Push it and open a PR whose base is the sync branch, linking the issue with `Closes #<issue>`. Explain why the adaptation belongs in the fork rather than upstream.

Keep independent remediations in separate issue/PR pairs. If one remediation depends on another, stack it on the dependency branch and state the dependency in both PRs. Do not create speculative issues: uncertainty belongs in the sync PR audit until evidence establishes an actual compatibility gap.

Completion criterion: every required remediation has exactly one owning issue and an implementation PR, with dependencies explicit and checks reported.

## 5. Complete the gate

- Update the sync PR body with the final classification table and links to every remediation issue and PR.
- Mark the sync PR ready for review only when no remediation remains unowned and all remediation PRs target a branch that will feed into the sync branch.
- Leave a merge-order checklist: remediation PRs first, sync PR last.
- Return the sync PR URL, upstream range, compatibility summary, issue/PR pairs, validation results, and merge order.

Never merge, close, or retarget PRs on the user's behalf.
