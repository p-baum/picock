# Design It Twice

When the user wants to explore alternative interfaces for a chosen deepening candidate, use this independent-design pattern. Based on "Design It Twice" (Ousterhout) — your first idea is unlikely to be the best.

Uses the vocabulary in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) — **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**.

## Process

### 1. Frame the problem space

Before starting the design passes, write a user-facing explanation of the problem space for the chosen candidate:

- The constraints any new interface would need to satisfy
- The dependencies it would rely on, and which category they fall into (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
- A rough illustrative code sketch to ground the constraints — not a proposal, just a way to make the constraints concrete

Show this to the user, then immediately proceed to Step 2.

### 2. Run independent design passes

Produce 3+ **radically different** interfaces for the deepened module.

If the `Agent` tool is available, send all design passes as parallel `Agent` calls in one message, using `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and an independent prompt for each constraint. In Pi, install [`@tintinweb/pi-subagents`](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents) with `pi install npm:@tintinweb/pi-subagents` and restart Pi to provide the same Claude-compatible tool and isolated sessions.

If the `Agent` tool is unavailable, tell the user about the Pi extension and run the passes sequentially in degraded mode. Write the shared technical brief and each constraint to separate temporary notes. For each pass, start from the shared brief without reading earlier designs, save the result to its own note, and only read all designs after every pass is complete. This prevents an early design from anchoring the later ones. Delete the temporary notes after comparison.

Give each pass the same technical brief (file paths, coupling details, dependency category from [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md), what sits behind the seam) but a different design constraint:

- Agent 1: "Minimize the interface — aim for 1–3 entry points max. Maximise leverage per entry point."
- Agent 2: "Maximise flexibility — support many use cases and extension."
- Agent 3: "Optimise for the most common caller — make the default case trivial."
- Agent 4 (if applicable): "Design around ports & adapters for cross-seam dependencies."

Include both [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) vocabulary and CONTEXT.md vocabulary in the brief so each pass names things consistently with the architecture language and the project's domain language.

Each pass outputs:

1. Interface (types, methods, params — plus invariants, ordering, error modes)
2. Usage example showing how callers use it
3. What the implementation hides behind the seam
4. Dependency strategy and adapters (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
5. Trade-offs — where leverage is high, where it's thin

### 3. Present and compare

Present designs sequentially so the user can absorb each one, then compare them in prose. Contrast by **depth** (leverage at the interface), **locality** (where change concentrates), and **seam placement**.

After comparing, give your own recommendation: which design you think is strongest and why. If elements from different designs would combine well, propose a hybrid. Be opinionated — the user wants a strong read, not a menu.
